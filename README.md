# Let's Encrypt Certificate Automation for Azure Key Vault

This project provides an automated workflow to generate Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for **subdomains**, using **Cloudflare DNS-01 challenge**, and securely **upload them to Azure Key Vault**.

---

## Overview

This repository contains:
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/letsencrypt-cert.yml`)
- Two shell scripts:
  - `scripts/generate_cert.sh`: Generates an SSL certificate using `acme.sh` and converts it to `.pfx`.
  - `scripts/upload_to_kv.sh`: Uploads the generated `.pfx` certificate to Azure Key Vault.

---

## Features

- Supports **manual trigger** with custom domain input.
- Uses **Cloudflare API** to validate domain ownership via DNS challenge.
- Uses **OIDC-based authentication** with federated credentials to authenticate to Azure.
- Certificate is stored in Azure Key Vault in `.pfx` format.
- Certificate name is automatically derived from the domain (`subdomain.domain.com â†’ subdomain-domain-com`).
